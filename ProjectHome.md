# XmegaDuino #

Port the [Arduino](http://www.arduino.cc) IDE, core, libraries and bootloader to support the Atmel XMEGA family of chips.

The XmegaDuino project has been moved to https://github.com/akafugu/Xmegaduino and the primary developer is now Karl Backstrom. He has made fantastic progress on XmegaDuino.

With the ARM based Due looking like the future "high end" of the Arduino line, I believe the xmega would be fantastic as the future "low end".
