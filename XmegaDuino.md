# Introduction #

The XMEGA is a new family of 8 bit microcontrollers from Atmel. The XmegaDuino project is porting the [Arduino](http://www.arduino.cc) runtime, bootloader, and IDE to XMEGA chips.

The initial target is the Atmel Xplain evaluation board with an xmega128a1 mcu.

The XmegaDuino project will also port to a number of other boards.
